[Quantum Chromodynamics &ndash; What Makes the Strong Force Strong?](https://youtu.be/y1px8hBl7zg?t=787)
<br>The video that finally catalyzed the creation of _vagari_.

[Awakening from the Meaning Crisis](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ)
<br>A wonderful series about history, philosophy, and the
meaning of _meaning_; it provided the energy needed to publish _vagari_.

[Arrival: A Response To Bad Movies](https://youtu.be/z18LY6NME1s)
<br>An awakening to the importance of linguistics, story, non-zero-sum games,
and ultimately, the craft of combining _good_ ideas.

#### Colors as the Symbols, Design as the Grammar

‚Æ© i.e., acknowledge that color (and design itself) is a system of communication with an evolutionary history. ‚ÆØ

Mining meaning from media, or rather, the **exploration of culture** via the most dominant mediums:

#### Chaos is not _chaotic_

[Chaos is a mathematical concept](https://youtu.be/fDek6cYijxI); an intrinsic
pattern of the universe that arises in non-linear systems. ‚ÆØ

Creativity is not a some special, dualistic force ("_the muse_,") that only
humans possess. **Creativity _is_ Chaos**&mdash;it's an emergent property that originates from the of the
embrace of sensitive starting conditions in dynamical systems (e.g., human
minds), coupled with, but not limited to:

- **[curiosity](https://youtu.be/_XWRF1UArO4)** in the _unknown_, and an deep desire _to **understand**_.
- **[courage](https://youtu.be/dKz095P7LdU)** to challenge the _status quo_, and everlasting itch _to **explore**_.
- **[humility](https://youtu.be/Tfrrubw7pcE)** in allowing the _process_ to unfold, and willingness _to **fail**_.

#### Is Fashion Invented, or Discovered?

‚Æ© [Most Adavance, Yet Acceptable](https://youtu.be/mgyGptmH7EE); evolution acts
on [mutations during replication](https://youtu.be/UhSStR-FpQc) of existing
entities. ‚ÆØ

[Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEvMHRgPdyk) is analogous to the
concept of [fitness](https://youtu.be/UhSStR-FpQc) in evolution applied, when
applied to culture&mdash;it's easy to think that **fashion** (_evolution_) is a
forward march that makes better and better **styles** (_organisms_). Instead,
fashion is a "_bumbling mess that just gets lucky sometimes_," i.e.:

1. Expression (and imitation) of a style is the primary way that it is
   replicated.
2. The primary niche to be filled is in the domain **self-expression**, with a sub-domain of **functionality**.
3. Thus, a relatively good (_fit_) style is one that allows the users to
   express something about themselves (color), while maintaining functionality (design grammar), in
   order for expression to be noticed by others.
4. Hence, _vagari_'s primary use case: a **color scheme**; further design
   principles are simply means to create a more cohesive and deep meaning
   behind the selection of color.

If the hypothesis of _vagari_ is correct, then in a sense fashion is
discovered. I.e., the most fashionable style of the time is found via somewhat
random exploration. However, in a sense fashion also invented, because
ultimately style (the result of the proccess of fashion) is created as a means to out-replicate competing styles.

## ü¢£ Design Principles

### Sex

‚Æ© i.e., the ["Swedish number for six"](https://youtu.be/Iwpi1Lm6dFo?t=777), or the
maximum number of objects in focus at a given time. ‚ÆØ

Jokes aside, the sex principle is more than just a joke&mdash;it's about
dealing with **[cognitive overhead](https://youtu.be/fCn8zs912OE?t=412)**. As a whole, design must be _simple and
sexy_, not _minimal and mundane_. This principle is core to _vagari_ and
represents the adherence of the [selfish memes/genes](https://youtu.be/2mTVtToioLg) theory of replicators with unbounded evolution, i.e.:

1. Something is _sexy_ if it is attractive or exciting, and in the realms of ideas, desire for replication.
2. _Communication_ is all about replicating an idea inside another mind, but it's not perfect&mdash;mutations occur.
3. Thus, a good design is one that is enticing, welcoming a new idea, with minimal (but not zero) mutations.
4. Hence, the adoption of, and iteration on, well known and attractive design principles:
   - [Understanding the Principles of Design](https://youtu.be/UmHMVU6dceA)
     - [6 Golden Rules Of Layout Design](https://youtu.be/EFf9jBs2yfU)
     - [8 Important Composition Tips](https://youtu.be/VArISvUuyr0)
     - [Breaking Down the Principles of Design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/gui/principles-of-design-infographic)
     - [Exploring the Gestalt Principles of Design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/gestalt-principles-of-design)
   - [The 60&ndash;30&ndash;10 Rule](https://youtu.be/UWwNIMHFdW4)
     - [Dominance of Two Colors](https://youtu.be/YCJXS4hvOsU)
   - [How to Break Rules](https://youtu.be/06zi53J_BBw)

The essential idea here involves minimizing the impact of anything that _stresses working memory_, i.e.:

- Maximum of [**6** _objects_](https://youtu.be/Iwpi1Lm6dFo?t=777) in a _scene_, i.e., 6 _things_ that require increased discernment.
- Maximum of [**3** _layers_](https://youtu.be/CFRhGnuXG-4) to an _object_, i.e., 3 _variations_ that track change within an object.

Ideally, properly embracing this principle ought to result in an easier to manage
[punctuated equilibrium](https://youtu.be/qSjiFxIHknk) between [abstraction and
coupling](https://youtu.be/rQlMtztiAoA) via evolution in design by the sexual
selection of interested minds.

### Complexity

‚Æ© i.e., a dance involving [computational
irreducibly](https://youtu.be/mfW7pvlrzyM),
[information](https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA?t=485), and
[choas](https://github.com/nosvagor/vagari#chaos-is-not-chaotic). ‚ÆØ

Particularly, _vagari_'s philosophy is obsessed with complex systems. Because
of this, the embrace of choas is at the core of the design philosophy. _vagari_
is not looking for _the answer_&mdash;_vagari_ is looking for **an answer**;
always open to a new answer, or a new way of approaching problems.

The starting point of many decisions usually draw upon inspiration from the
apparent universality of various mathematical concepts or patterns (e.g.,
[factals](https://youtu.be/-RdOwhmqP5s?t=675) and [holomorphic
dynamics](https://youtu.be/LqbZpur38nw)), hopefully resulting in the injection
of mathematical meaning (e.g., [the logistic map](https://youtu.be/ovJcsL7vyrk)
and [Feigenbaum constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feigenbaum_constants) for
some contrast ratios).

> "There are no separate systems. The world is a continuum. Where to draw a
> boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion."
> &ndash; <cite>Donella H. Meadows</cite>

Ideally, properly embracing this principle means a embarking on constant exploration of
alternative approaches via the willingness depart from the respectable (but not holy) constraints initially set by interesting maths.

### Saga

‚Æ© i.e., [imagination is the key to cooperation](https://youtu.be/LLucUmQVBAE); shared exploration of fiction is how we create useful norms. ‚ÆØ

Essentially, if you could not tell already, story (_meaning_) is a huge factor
in the philosophy of _vagari_. Anyone can make a [color
scheme](https://www.slant.co/topics/358/~best-color-themes-for-text-editors),
and many others will be better for certain people in certain contexts. In the
end, _vagari_ is not trying to be the _best_, or _most popular_, color scheme
([functionality/appeal is are just a useful qualitieis](https://github.com/nosvagor/vagari#is-fashion-invented-or-discovered)).

Instead, at it's core, _vagari_ is trying to be the most _meaningful_ color
scheme. _vagari_ assumes that most other color schemes do not allow the _art of
color_ to transcend functionality. The solution is to allow the users to say
something about themselves&mdash;a reason to choose, share, and improve this
color scheme, rather than any of the other adequate (and exceptional) color
schemes out there.

Related principles and concepts not already mentioned:

1. [Once Upon A.I.](https://youtu.be/nG9dMHTCKNU)
2. [The Angle's Cocktail](https://youtu.be/Nj-hdQMa3uA)
3. [What would you do, even if you knew you **would fail**?](https://youtu.be/XAE46z9wT0A)

Ideally, properly embracing this principle ought to compel users to want to
proudly display and share _vagari_, resulting in a positive feedback loop of _meaning_ via the injection of _new meaning_, provided by _new users_.

### Collaboration

‚Æ© id est, _[ignoramus et ignorabimus](https://youtu.be/HeQX2HjkcNo)_, **_tamen id conamur_** ‚ÆØ
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;‚Æ© i.e., _we do not know and will not know_, **_[yet we try regardless](https://youtu.be/tye525dkfi8)_**. ‚ÆØ

The above phrase is the best simple representation the core philosophy of
_vagari_.

Perhaps, the two most relevant books to the formation of this principle:

1. [The Beginning of Infinity](https://a.co/d/1s4J1Lj), by David Deutsch
2. [The Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com), by Balaji Srinivasan

One might be tempted to ask: _"why so does vagari seem so&mldr; pretentious?"_

Well, to be frank: _vagari is pretentious_; it's kind of essential to success of the project, actually.

Ideally, shared participation in this fiction will hopefully manifest a reality
among the participants. The philosophy of _vagari_ is built upon the idea that
[collaboration is the ultimate force for discovery](https://youtu.be/_ArVh3Cj9rw). Sure, one node in a network may be
the seed, or the spark, for a cascade of activation&mldr; but it's the activity
in the network itself that creates the **gestalt**, i.e., the unique property of
a whole that is more than the sum of its parts.
